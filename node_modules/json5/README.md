# JSON5 – Modern JSON

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/json5/json5.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/json5/json5)

JSON is an excellent data format, but we think it can be better.

**JSON5 is a proposed extension to JSON** that aims to make it easier for
*humans to write and maintain* by hand. It does this by adding some minimal
syntax features directly from ECMAScript 5.

JSON5 remains a **strict subset of JavaScript**, adds **no new data types**,
and **works with all existing JSON content**.

JSON5 is *not* an official successor to JSON, and JSON5 content may *not*
work with existing JSON parsers. For this reason, JSON5 files use a new .json5
extension. *(TODO: new MIME type needed too.)*

The code here is a **reference JavaScript implementation** for both Node.js
and all browsers. It’s based directly off of Douglas Crockford’s own [JSON
implementation][json_parse.js], and it’s both robust and secure.


## Why

JSON isn’t the friendliest to *write*. Keys need to be quoted, objects and
arrays can’t have trailing commas, and comments aren’t allowed — even though
none of these are the case with regular JavaScript today.

That was fine when JSON’s goal was to be a great data format, but JSON’s usage
has expanded beyond *machines*. JSON is now used for writing [configs][ex1],
[manifests][ex2], even [tests][ex3] — all by *humans*.

[ex1]: http://plovr.com/docs.html
[ex2]: https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html
[ex3]: http://code.google.com/p/fuzztester/wiki/JSONFileFormat

There are other formats that are human-friendlier, like YAML, but changing
from JSON to a completely different format is undesirable in many cases.
JSON5’s aim is to remain close to JSON and JavaScript.


## Features

The following is the exact list of additions to JSON’s syntax introduced by
JSON5. **All of these are optional**, and **all of these come from ES5**.

### Objects

- Object keys can be unquoted if they’re valid [identifiers][mdn_variables].
  Yes, even reserved keywords (like `default`) are valid unquoted keys in ES5
  [[§11.1.5](http://es5.github.com/#x11.1.5), [§7.6](http://es5.github.com/#x7.6)].
  ([More info](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers))

  *(TODO: Unicode characters and escape sequences aren’t yet supported in this
  implementation.)*
  
- Object keys can also be single-quoted.

- Objects can have trailing commas.

[mdn_variables]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Core_Language_Features#Variables

### Arrays

- Arrays can have trailing commas.

### Strings

- Strings can be single-quoted.

- Strings can be split across multiple lines; just prefix each newline with a
  backslash. [ES5 [§7.8.4](http://es5.github.com/#x7.8.4)]

### Numbers

- Numbers can be hexadecimal (base 16).

- Numbers can begin or end with a (leading or trailing) decimal point.

- Numbers can include `Infinity`, `-Infinity`,  `NaN`, and `-NaN`.

- Numbers can begin with an explicit plus sign.

### Comments

- Both inline (single-line) and block (multi-line) comments are allowed.


## Example

The following is a contrived example, but it illustrates most of the features:

```js
{
    foo: 'bar',
    while: true,

    this: 'is a \
multi-line string',

    // this is an inline comment
    here: 'is another', // inline comment

    /* this is a block comment
       that continues on another line */

    hex: 0xDEADbeef,
    half: .5,
    delta: +10,
    to: Infinity,   // and beyond!

    finally: 'a trailing comma',
    oh: [
        "we shouldn't forget",
        'arrays can have',
        'trailing commas too',
    ],
}
```

This implementation’s own [package.json5](package.json5) is more realistic:

```js
// This file is written in JSON5 syntax, naturally, but npm needs a regular
// JSON file, so compile via `npm run build`. Be sure to keep both in sync!

## Usage

This JavaScript implementation of JSON5 simply provides a `JSON5` object just
like the native ES5 `JSON` object.

To use from Node:

The JSON5 Data Interchange Format (JSON5) is a superset of [JSON] that aims to
alleviate some of the limitations of JSON by expanding its syntax to include
some productions from [ECMAScript 5.1].

This JavaScript library is the official reference implementation for JSON5
parsing and serialization libraries.

[JSON]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159

[ECMAScript 5.1]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/

## Summary of Features
The following ECMAScript 5.1 features, which are not supported in JSON, have
been extended to JSON5.

### Objects
- Object keys may be an ECMAScript 5.1 _[IdentifierName]_.
- Objects may have a single trailing comma.

### Arrays
- Arrays may have a single trailing comma.

### Strings
- Strings may be single quoted.
- Strings may span multiple lines by escaping new line characters.
- Strings may include character escapes.

### Numbers
- Numbers may be hexadecimal.
- Numbers may have a leading or trailing decimal point.
- Numbers may be [IEEE 754] positive infinity, negative infinity, and NaN.
- Numbers may begin with an explicit plus sign.

### Comments
- Single and multi-line comments are allowed.

### White Space
- Additional white space characters are allowed.

[IdentifierName]: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-7.6

[IEEE 754]: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4610933

## Short Example
```js
{
  // comments
  unquoted: 'and you can quote me on that',
  singleQuotes: 'I can use "double quotes" here',
  lineBreaks: "Look, Mom! \
No \\n's!",
  hexadecimal: 0xdecaf,
  leadingDecimalPoint: .8675309, andTrailing: 8675309.,
  positiveSign: +1,
  trailingComma: 'in objects', andIn: ['arrays',],
  "backwardsCompatible": "with JSON",
}
```

## Specification
For a detailed explanation of the JSON5 format, please read the [official
specification](https://json5.github.io/json5-spec/).

## Installation
### Node.js
>>>>>>> joan
```sh
npm install json5
```

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
var JSON5 = require('json5');
```

To use in the browser (adds the `JSON5` object to the global namespace):

```html
<script src="json5.js"></script>
```

Then in both cases, you can simply replace native `JSON` calls with `JSON5`:

```js
var obj = JSON5.parse('{unquoted:"key",trailing:"comma",}');
var str = JSON5.stringify(obj);
```

`JSON5.parse` supports all of the JSON5 features listed above (*TODO: except
Unicode*), as well as the native [`reviver` argument][json-parse].

[json-parse]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse

`JSON5.stringify` mainly avoids quoting keys where possible, but we hope to
keep expanding it in the future (e.g. to also output trailing commas).
It supports the native [`replacer` and `space` arguments][json-stringify],
as well. *(TODO: Any implemented `toJSON` methods aren’t used today.)*

[json-stringify]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify


### Extras

If you’re running this on Node, you can also register a JSON5 `require()` hook
to let you `require()` `.json5` files just like you can `.json` files:

```js
require('json5/lib/require');
require('./path/to/foo');   // tries foo.json5 after foo.js, foo.json, etc.
require('./path/to/bar.json5');
```

This module also provides a `json5` executable (requires Node) for converting
JSON5 files to JSON:

```sh
json5 -c path/to/foo.json5    # generates path/to/foo.json
```


## Development

```sh
git clone git://github.com/aseemk/json5.git
cd json5
npm install
npm test
```

As the `package.json5` file states, be sure to run `npm run build` on changes
to `package.json5`, since npm requires `package.json`.

Feel free to [file issues](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues) and submit
[pull requests](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pulls) — contributions are
welcome. If you do submit a pull request, please be sure to add or update the
tests, and ensure that `npm test` continues to pass.

=======
const JSON5 = require('json5')
```

### Browsers
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/json5@^1.0.0"></script>
```

This will create a global `JSON5` variable.

## API
The JSON5 API is compatible with the [JSON API].

[JSON API]:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON

### JSON5.parse()
Parses a JSON5 string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by
the string. An optional reviver function can be provided to perform a
transformation on the resulting object before it is returned.

#### Syntax
    JSON5.parse(text[, reviver])

#### Parameters
- `text`: The string to parse as JSON5.
- `reviver`: If a function, this prescribes how the value originally produced by
  parsing is transformed, before being returned.

#### Return value
The object corresponding to the given JSON5 text.

### JSON5.stringify()
Converts a JavaScript value to a JSON5 string, optionally replacing values if a
replacer function is specified, or optionally including only the specified
properties if a replacer array is specified.

#### Syntax
    JSON5.stringify(value[, replacer[, space]])
    JSON5.stringify(value[, options])

#### Parameters
- `value`: The value to convert to a JSON5 string.
- `replacer`: A function that alters the behavior of the stringification
  process, or an array of String and Number objects that serve as a whitelist
  for selecting/filtering the properties of the value object to be included in
  the JSON5 string. If this value is null or not provided, all properties of the
  object are included in the resulting JSON5 string.
- `space`: A String or Number object that's used to insert white space into the
  output JSON5 string for readability purposes. If this is a Number, it
  indicates the number of space characters to use as white space; this number is
  capped at 10 (if it is greater, the value is just 10). Values less than 1
  indicate that no space should be used. If this is a String, the string (or the
  first 10 characters of the string, if it's longer than that) is used as white
  space. If this parameter is not provided (or is null), no white space is used.
  If white space is used, trailing commas will be used in objects and arrays.
- `options`: An object with the following properties:
  - `replacer`: Same as the `replacer` parameter.
  - `space`: Same as the `space` parameter.
  - `quote`: A String representing the quote character to use when serializing
    strings.

#### Return value
A JSON5 string representing the value.

### Node.js `require()` JSON5 files
When using Node.js, you can `require()` JSON5 files by adding the following
statement.

```js
require('json5/lib/register')
```

Then you can load a JSON5 file with a Node.js `require()` statement. For
example:

```js
const config = require('./config.json5')
```

## CLI
Since JSON is more widely used than JSON5, this package includes a CLI for
converting JSON5 to JSON and for validating the syntax of JSON5 documents.

### Installation
```sh
npm install --global json5
```

### Usage
```sh
json5 [options] <file>
```

If `<file>` is not provided, then STDIN is used.

#### Options:
- `-s`, `--space`: The number of spaces to indent or `t` for tabs
- `-o`, `--out-file [file]`: Output to the specified file, otherwise STDOUT
- `-v`, `--validate`: Validate JSON5 but do not output JSON
- `-V`, `--version`: Output the version number
- `-h`, `--help`: Output usage information

## Contibuting
### Development
```sh
git clone https://github.com/json5/json5
cd json5
npm install
```
